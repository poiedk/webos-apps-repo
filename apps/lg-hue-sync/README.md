Native ambient-light synchronization for rooted LG webOS TVs. A Rust daemon captures the displayed image, derives spatial colours, and streams them to Philips Hue Entertainment, Nanoleaf 4D, and WLED. A responsive LAN dashboard provides pairing, calibration, presets, and independent output controls.

## Features

- Root-only webOS capture through dynamically loaded `libvtcapture`/`dile_vt` APIs.
- Hue Entertainment API v2 over DTLS 1.2 PSK, including gradient member identity.
- Nanoleaf 4D UDP streaming with 40-panel corner, direction, and offset alignment.
- WLED realtime DDP/UDP streaming with per-LED perimeter sampling, configurable LED count, start corner, direction, offset, and output trim.
- Independent Hue/Nanoleaf/WLED controls; TV sleep/wake following can be automatic or manual.
- Letterbox-aware sampling, HDR compression, OLED black gating, smoothing, and bounded scene changes.
- Responsive dashboard at `http://<tv-ip>:8088/` with system, dark, and light themes.

## Limits and safety

- Root access is required. Rooting can void warranties or render a TV unusable; confirm model and firmware compatibility first.
- DRM-protected native webOS apps may expose black capture surfaces. External HDMI playback is the reliable path for protected content.
- Hue decides how physical gradient segments are grouped into Entertainment channels. This project streams the selected area's returned channels; it does not fabricate more.
- LG private capture APIs and community root methods are unsupported by LG and may change with firmware.

Check [cani.rootmy.tv](https://cani.rootmy.tv/) and [webOS Brew](https://github.com/webosbrew) before changing a TV.

## Requirements

- Development host with Rust, Docker, `make`, SSH, and `uv`.
- Rooted webOS TV with root SSH and compatible capture libraries.
- Hue Bridge v2, Nanoleaf 4D, and/or a WLED controller on the same LAN.

## Validate and build

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo test
cargo clippy --bin lg-hue-sync -- -D warnings
make build
file target/armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabi/release/lg-hue-sync
```

The canonical target build uses Debian Buster to stay within the LG C1/webOS 6 glibc ceiling. A macOS host build is useful for tests, but cannot run on the TV.

The official community [webosbrew/native-toolchain](https://github.com/webosbrew/native-toolchain) remains the reference webOS SDK. It currently cannot link this Rust dependency graph because its libc lacks `getauxval`, required by Rust's supported ARM standard library and `ring`; see [docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md) for the re-evaluation gate.

## Install and update

First installation, after root SSH already works:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh <tv-ip>
```

Existing installation, preserving paired credentials and layout:

```bash
make deploy-bin TV_IP=<tv-ip>
```

Then open `http://<tv-ip>:8088/`. Pair Hue/Nanoleaf if used; for WLED, enter the controller IP and LED count, save the controller, run the perimeter tracer, align LED 0/start direction, and save settings. Never copy a populated `config.json` between users or commit it.

Build, rollback, uninstall, and verification details: [docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md).

## Development commands

```bash
cargo run -- pair --bridge <bridge-ip> --output config.json
cargo run -- pair-nanoleaf --ip <controller-ip> --config config.json
cargo run -- sync-hue --config config.json
cargo run -- test-pattern --config config.json
cargo run -- test-nanoleaf --config config.json
cargo run -- test-wled --config config.json
cargo run -- run --config config.json
```

Pairing and patterns affect physical devices. Use them only when the owner expects light output.

## Configuration

Start from [config.example.json](config.example.json), or pair through the dashboard. Runtime configuration contains secrets and stays untracked. On the TV:

```text
/var/home/root/lg-hue-sync/config.json
```

Hue v2 HTTPS calls use a scoped SHA-256 certificate pin established during physical push-link pairing. WLED does not require pairing credentials for DDP; the configured controller must be reachable on the LAN, and WLED realtime input must be enabled. Status endpoints never return Hue or Nanoleaf secrets.

## Project layout

```text
