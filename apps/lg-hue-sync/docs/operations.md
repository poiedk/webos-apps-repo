# Build and TV operations

Use `<tv-ip>` explicitly. Never add a private address or populated configuration to the repository.

## Local gate

```bash
make check
```

## Codex project setup

Codex loads [`.codex/environments/environment.toml`](../.codex/environments/environment.toml) from this repository. It sets up new worktrees with `make setup` and adds actions to update dependencies, refresh Rust stable, validate/build, transfer to the TV, and clean Docker builds. Leave automatic worktree cleanup empty so reusable Docker caches survive.

The transfer action reads `TV_IP=<tv-ip>` from `~/.config/lg-hue-sync/device.env` on the local host, or from its terminal environment. Add `SSH_PORT=<port>` there only if it differs from 22. This file stays outside Git and is not copied into a worktree.

Docker Desktop must be running for toolchain update, build, transfer, and cache-clean actions. Ordinary builds reuse the most recently built stable Rust image; **Update Rust toolchain** refreshes stable Rust on the host, rebuilds the image without Docker's layer cache, then runs host checks and the ARM build. Transfer preserves the TV's paired `config.json`, verifies the uploaded binary checksum, and restarts the daemon.

## Target build

```bash
make build
file target/armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabi/release/lg-hue-sync
llvm-readelf -h target/armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabi/release/lg-hue-sync
llvm-readelf --version-info target/armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabi/release/lg-hue-sync
```

Required result: 32-bit ARM Linux ELF with no required symbol newer than `GLIBC_2.28`. On Linux, GNU `readelf` is equivalent.

`make build` uses `docker/Dockerfile.cross`, which bakes the archived Debian Buster packages, the stable Rust toolchain, ARMv7 target, and linker into `lg-hue-sync-cross`. The cached image remains at its installed Rust release until `make toolchain-update` refreshes it. Cargo registry and target artifacts live in named Docker volumes, so subsequent builds are incremental. `make cross-clean` removes this project's cross-toolchain images and both caches when disk space matters.

Codex and developers use this same target rather than maintaining separate toolchains. GitHub Actions also runs it on every push to `main`; the ordinary CI job separately checks formatting, host tests, Clippy, and embedded dashboard JavaScript.

## Dependencies

```bash
make deps-check   # dry-run compatible Cargo.lock updates and show duplicate versions
make deps-update  # update Cargo.lock within Cargo.toml version constraints
```

Dependency updates are deliberate direct-to-`main` changes: inspect `Cargo.lock`, run the local gate and `make build`, then commit. Automated dependency pull requests are intentionally not enabled for this single-maintainer workflow.

### webOS Brew native toolchain

[`webosbrew/native-toolchain`](https://github.com/webosbrew/native-toolchain) is the community reference SDK. On macOS, download the matching Darwin archive, extract it to a path without spaces, and run its `relocate-sdk.sh`. Its CMake toolchain file is under `share/buildroot/toolchainfile.cmake`.

An older SDK revision was evaluated previously and failed to satisfy `getauxval` for the Rust
dependency graph. The current OpenLGTV `2026.08-webos` SDK changes that boundary by shipping a static
`glibc-polyfills` library that includes a `getauxval` backport. Rust's `-nodefaultlibs`
link mode means this project links that library explicitly.
The normal Debian Buster container remains canonical for webOS 5/6, while `make build-webos3`
uses the newer community SDK as an isolated compatibility path for older firmware. [`hyperhdr-webos-loader`](https://github.com/webosbrew/hyperhdr-webos-loader) remains the reference for native service, frontend, autostart, and IPK layout; it uses the same Buildroot SDK, but does not solve this Rust libc boundary.

## First install

Root SSH must already work; rooting is a separate owner action.

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh <tv-ip>
```

The script installs the binary, Luna permissions, service unit, boot hook, and launcher package. It does not upload `config.json` unless `--with-config` is supplied explicitly.

### Ares transfer tools

The official Rust rewrite is [`webosbrew/ares-cli-rs`](https://github.com/webosbrew/ares-cli-rs). This workstation keeps Node commands unchanged and exposes the verified Rust v0.7.0 binaries as `ares-rs-*` aliases. Upstream shares the OSE registry, but LG's Node TV CLI uses a separate `~/.webos/tv` registry here, so `lgc1` is registered in both.

```bash
ares-rs-setup-device --add tv --info host=<tv-ip> --info username=root --info port=22 --info keyPath=<ssh-private-key>
ares-rs-package webos-app --outdir target
ares-rs-install --device tv target/org.webosbrew.lg-hue-sync_<version>_all.ipk
ares-rs-push --device tv <local-file> <remote-path>
ares-rs-shell --device tv '<command>'
```

Node equivalents (`ares-package`, `ares-install`, `ares-push`, `ares-shell`) remain supported. Ares handles the launcher app and ordinary transfer. Root-owned daemon/service provisioning still uses the repository's SSH workflow until the IPK owns and verifies the complete install/uninstall lifecycle.

## Safe binary update

```bash
make build
make deploy-bin TV_IP=<tv-ip>
```

The update retains `config.json`, backs up the previous binary, uploads through a temporary filename, and restarts the service.

## Verification

```bash
shasum -a 256 target/armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabi/release/lg-hue-sync
ssh root@<tv-ip> 'sha256sum /var/home/root/lg-hue-sync/lg-hue-sync'
ssh root@<tv-ip> 'systemctl is-active lg-hue-sync'
curl --fail --silent http://<tv-ip>:8088/api/status
```

Match digests, require `active`, and inspect dashboard JSON. Physical capture-to-light behavior needs a visible check; a healthy process alone is insufficient.

## Rollback

```bash
ssh root@<tv-ip> 'systemctl stop lg-hue-sync && cp /var/home/root/lg-hue-sync/lg-hue-sync.previous /var/home/root/lg-hue-sync/lg-hue-sync && chmod 755 /var/home/root/lg-hue-sync/lg-hue-sync && systemctl start lg-hue-sync'
```

## Uninstall

```bash
./scripts/uninstall.sh <tv-ip>
```

Default behavior preserves `config.json` in a timestamped backup directory. Use `--purge-config` only when the owner explicitly wants credentials removed.

## Diagnostics

- Hue layout changed: dashboard **Refresh selected area layout**.
- Gradient count unexpected: inspect `entertainment_configuration.channels[].members`; physical segment count differs from stream-channel count.
- Nanoleaf order wrong: run **4D Tracer**, then adjust corner, direction, and offset under **Calibration**.
- Standby leaves lights owned: enable **Follow TV power** and inspect transition logs.


## Legacy webOS 3.x build

The normal `make build` target remains the canonical webOS 5/6 build and is intentionally unchanged.
For older TVs, use the separate community-SDK build:

```bash
make build-webos3
file target/webos3-armv7/lg-hue-sync
readelf --version-info target/webos3-armv7/lg-hue-sync
```

This path pins the OpenLGTV/webOS Buildroot SDK release `2026.08-webos`. The SDK ships a static
`glibc-polyfills` compatibility library with a `getauxval` backport. Rust uses
`-nodefaultlibs` for this target, so `build.rs` requests that SDK library explicitly instead of
relying on the patched GCC driver's default library injection. The project adds only the remaining
narrow syscall wrappers currently needed by modern Rust dependencies (`gettid` and `sendmmsg`).
These legacy additions are enabled only when `LG_WEBOS_LEGACY=1`; they are not linked into host
builds or the normal Debian Buster target.

Do not deploy the legacy binary blindly. First run the read-only TV probe:

```bash
make probe-tv TV_IP=<tv-ip>
```

Review the reported libc version, `libdile_vt` presence/symbols, architecture, `/dev/mem`
access, and service support. A successful cross-build proves link compatibility with the SDK,
not that a particular firmware's capture quirks are correct. Physical capture and WLED output
still require supervised on-device verification.


### webOS 3.4 capture quirk

The DILE backend detects webOS 3.4 from `/etc/starfish-release` or `/etc/os-release`.
On that firmware family it prefers the legacy `DILE_VT_Create(0)` initialization path and tries
the undocumented DILE dump location `2` first, matching the webosbrew/hyperion-webos
`QUIRK_ALTERNATIVE_DUMP_LOCATION` behavior. If a vendor variant rejects location `2`, the
backend falls back to `DISPLAY_OUTPUT` and then `SCALER_OUTPUT`. Newer firmware keeps the
existing CreateEx-first behavior.
